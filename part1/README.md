# HBnB Evolution – Technical Documentation (Part 1)

## Overview

This document presents the technical documentation for the first phase of the HBnB Evolution project, a simplified AirBnB-like application. It describes the overall architecture, detailed business logic design, and interaction among the system’s components.

This material will serve as a guide for the upcoming implementation phases and provides a clear and detailed blueprint of the system.

---

## 1. High-Level Architecture

### Description

The application follows a layered architecture divided into:

- **Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction via services and APIs.  
- **Business Logic Layer:** Contains the core models and business logic.  
- **Persistence Layer:** Responsible for data storage and retrieval.

These layers communicate through the **Facade** pattern, which provides a unified interface to simplify interactions between them.

## 2. Business Logic Layer – Class Diagram

### Description

This diagram shows the main entities of the system and their relationships:

- **User:** Represents system users, identified as administrators or regular users.  
- **Place:** Properties listed by users, with attributes such as title, description, price, and location.  
- **Review:** Feedback left by users on places.  
- **Amenity:** Services and features associated with places.

Each entity inherits from a base class with common attributes (unique ID, creation date, and update date) for auditing purposes.

## 3. API Interaction Flow – Sequence Diagrams

### Description

The following diagrams illustrate the interaction flow between layers for key system operations.

---

### 3.1 User Registration

Shows the process of registering a new user, from API request through persistence to client response.

### 3.2 Place Creation

Describes how a user creates a new place, validating ownership and saving the data.

### 3.3 Review Submission

Demonstrates the flow for submitting a review for a visited place.

### 3.4 Fetching a List of Places

Details the process for retrieving a filtered list of available places.

## Design Decisions and Notes

- The layered architecture promotes separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.  
- The **Facade** pattern facilitates communication between layers, reducing coupling.  
- Inheriting from a base class ensures consistency in handling common attributes.  
- Relationships between entities accurately reflect the specified business rules.  
- Sequence diagrams help visualize the full flow of each key operation.

## Conclusion

This technical documentation provides a solid foundation for implementing the HBnB Evolution project. The included diagrams and explanations improve understanding of the design and component interactions, ensuring the following development steps proceed with clarity and direction.
